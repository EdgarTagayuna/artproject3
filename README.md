Initially, I wanted to create a push type surveillance of sorts using pixy2 and raspberry pi. By pushing the button, a video feed of sorts will play on the server.
In the end; however, I could not do it. Rather, I didn't know how to. In the end, I made a compromise, and repurposed the site.

Now, the purpose of the site/server is to check the accuracy of the particular device, pixy2 camera. It is done by gathering RGB values using the pixy2, and displaying those values on the site itself. The background will change depending on the object that is displayed in front of the pixy2 camera. The RGB values will also be displayed at that particular time or instance.
